## Description
I'm as disappointed as you when development officially stopped. Ever since development slowed down, and Mindustry updates before we could catch up, i knew that it was too much. When i quit development i felt aimless, i don't know what to do next. I feel it is ultimately my fault, i wanted something that matches my vision as much as possible, i dont want anyone except a very few to know my methods and ideas, i internally desire for control, no matter how much i tried to hide it. We've built so much, i still want to continue it in some way.

## Empathy
Its prison was enlisted for the outerversal war. However due to a mistake that suddenly end the war, costing most of the lives of those who oppose the End. Their bodies either annihilated, distort, or suddenly shifted; as their form is not supported in this sector of reality, only held together by the Kami. Those who survived either died from the forces of End, or stranded in this reality. The Prison Apathy wanders the universe aimlessly, waiting for its purpose to unleash the force inside it. Its unknown whether this force could compete with the End before the "Weakening".

## Despondency
A smaller variant of the original, lacks most of the capabilities but still devastating. Placed across the cosmos to annihilate and demoralizes those who go against The End.
