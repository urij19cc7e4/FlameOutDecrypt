    "description": "I'm as disappointed as you when development officially stopped. Ever since development slowed down, and Mindustry updates before we could catch up, i knew that it was too much. When i quit development i felt aimless, i don't know what to do next. I feel it is ultimately my fault, i wanted something that matches my vision as much as possible, i dont want anyone except a very few to know my methods and ideas, i internally desire for control, no matter how much i tried to hide it. We've built so much, i still want to continue it in some way.\n\nNot intended for multiplayer, low-end devices, or saving.",
